BUSCO-Plot-Py |ProjectVersion|
=========================================

Interpreting BUSCO output can be a bit challenging, this because it generates many files and folders containing 
information about the analysis, especially if you're not familiar with the specific details provided by the tool.

Buscoplotpy is a library that allows graphical visualization and proper interpretation of completeness analysis results 
obtained using the BUSCO software in a super-easy and user-friendly manner. By seamlessly integrating with popular 
data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, Buscoplotpy transforms the raw output generated by BUSCO into clear, 
insightful plots that facilitate a quick and comprehensive understanding of the genomic assessment.
